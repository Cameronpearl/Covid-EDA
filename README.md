## Description
This reprot seeks to explore data surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic with the most current data at the time of writing. Some quick cleaning was done in Excel to seperate the data into two tables, one for death data and one for vaccination data. I then uploaded it into my SQL Server database and used SQL to further clean and analyize the data in order to gain some insights. The SQL script has been uploaded here.
